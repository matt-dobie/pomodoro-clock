# Pomodoro Clock
This web app was developed as one of <a href="http://www.freecodecamp.com" target="_blank">freeCodeCamp's</a> advanced front-end projects. The goal was to create my own version of a Pomodoro Clock which, using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique" target="_blank">Pomodoro Technique</a>, helps the user to increase their productivity by scheduling alternating periods of work and break time. It was created with JavaScript, jQuery and CSS. This project was challenging, but I enjoyed gaining a better knowledge of JavaScript timing and overcoming its slight (but significant) inaccuracies.
